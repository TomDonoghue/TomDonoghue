## Research Projects

My research projects are mostly hosted on my own 
[profile](https://github.com/TomDonoghue) and/or on the Voytek lab's 
[organization](https://github.com/voytekresearch). 

Projects released through the Voytek lab are also indexed 
[here](https://github.com/voytekresearch/VoytekLab). 

### Parameterizing Neural Power Spectra

The Parameterizing Neural Power Spectra project explores a proposed method for measuring periodic and aperiodic activity in neural power spectra, and demonstrates a series of applications of the method.

[REPO](https://github.com/fooof-tools/Paper) - 
[PAPER](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00744-x)

### Band Ratios

The BandRatios project explores properties of band ratio measures in electrophysiological data, and compares them to spectral features.

[REPO](https://github.com/voytekresearch/BandRatios) - 
[PAPER](https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0192-20.2020)

### ERP-SCANR

The ERP-SCANR project mines the scientific literature to derive data-driven descriptions and comparisons of event-related potentials (ERPs).

[REPO](https://github.com/HSUpipeline/analyzeTH) - 
[PAPER](https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.23539)

## Teaching Materials

I work on educational materials and course development, for programming, data science, and cognitive science. 

### Introduction to Programming with Python (COGS18)

I developed an introductory class on programming with Python for cognitive scientists in the Department of Cognitive Science at UC San Diego.
