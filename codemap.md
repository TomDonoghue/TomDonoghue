## Open Source Packages

I develop and maintain open-source Python packages.
Each of the projects listed below has it's own organization. 

### SpecParam (formerly 'fooof')

I am lead developer of the [SpecParam](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof) package, a tool for parameterizing neural power spectra.

[REPO](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof) - 
[DOCS](https://fooof-tools.github.io/) - 
[PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/fooof/)

### NeuroDSP

I am a co-developer of the [NeuroDSP](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp) package for time-series analysis of neuroscientific data. 

[REPO](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp) - 
[DOCS](https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/) - 
[PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/neurodsp/)

### LISC

I am the lead developer of the [LISC](https://github.com/lisc-tools/lisc) package, a tool for collecting and analyzing scientific literature. 

[REPO](https://github.com/lisc-tools/lisc) - 
[DOCS](https://lisc-tools.github.io/) - 
[PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/lisc/)

### SpikeTools

I am the lead developer of the [spiketools](https://github.com/spiketools/spiketools) package, a tool for analyzing single-unit neural data.

[REPO](https://github.com/spiketools/spiketools) - 
[DOCS](https://spiketools.github.io/)

## Templates and Resources

I create and maintain templates for projects on the 
[StructuredScience](https://github.com/StructuredScience/) organization, 
an overview for which is [here](https://github.com/structuredscience/Overview).

I also create and curate lists of open resources on the
[OpenLists](https://github.com/openlists) organization, 
an overview for which is [here](https://github.com/openlists/Overview).

## Research Projects

My research projects are mostly hosted on my own 
[profile](https://github.com/TomDonoghue) and/or on the Voytek lab's 
[organization](https://github.com/voytekresearch). 

Projects released through the Voytek lab are also indexed 
[here](https://github.com/voytekresearch/VoytekLab). 

### Parameterizing Neural Power Spectra

The Parameterizing Neural Power Spectra project explores a proposed method for measuring periodic and aperiodic activity in neural power spectra, and demonstrates a series of applications of the method.

[Paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00744-x)

### Band Ratios

The BandRatios project explores properties of band ratio measures in electrophysiological data, and compares them to spectral features.

[Repository](https://github.com/voytekresearch/BandRatios) - 
[Paper](https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0192-20.2020)

### ERP-SCANR

The ERP-SCANR project mines the scientific literature to derive data-driven descriptions and comparisons of event-related potentials (ERPs).

[Repository](https://github.com/ERPscanr/ERPscanr) - 
[WebSite](https://erpscanr.github.io/) - 
[Paper](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/7ezmh)

### Oscillation Methods

The Oscillation Methods project explores methodological considerations for studying neural oscillations. 

[Repository](https://github.com/OscillationsMethods/OscillationsMethods) - 
[WebSite](https://oscillationmethods.github.io/) - 
[Paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.15361)

## Teaching Materials

I work on educational materials and course development, for programming, data science, and cognitive science. 

### Introduction to Programming with Python (COGS18)

I developed an introductory class on programming with Python for cognitive scientists in the Department of Cognitive Science at UC San Diego.

[Home](https://github.com/COGS18) - 
[Overview](https://github.com/COGS18/Overview)  - 
[Materials](https://github.com/COGS18/Materials) - 
[WebSite](https://cogs18.github.io)

There is also a [public website](https://introductorypython.github.io/) that hosts these materials. 

### Hands-On Data Science (COGS108)

I developed materials for a hands-on data science class, which is listed as COGS 108 in the Department of Cognitive Science at UC San Diego. This course was created by Professor Bradley Voytek. 

[Home](https://github.com/COGS108) - 
[Overview](https://github.com/COGS108/Overview)  - 
[Materials](https://github.com/COGS108/Tutorials)

There is also a [public website](https://datascienceinpractice.github.io/) that hosts these materials. 

### Introduction to Cognitive Science

A [collection](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/CogSciClass) of materials and links for teaching an introduction to cognitive science. 

### NeuroAI

A [collection](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/NeuroAI) of materials for a short course on the intersection between neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI). 

### Python Bootcamp

A [notebook](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/PythonBootcamp) with an overview of using / getting started with using Python for grad school, and some general programming tips.
